General notes, to-do-list, and changes to the Amber99SB force field.


1) Implementing the new atom types:

Tyrosine:

. Create atomtype OR in tyr. residue
. Change OH atomype in tyr to OR
. OR must have the same bonded parameters as OH


Asparagine:

. Create atomtype NQ in asn. residue
. Change atomtype N of ND2 to NQ
. NQ must have the same bonded parameters as N

Glutamine:

. Create atomtype NQ in gln. residue
. Change atomtype N of NE2 to NQ
. NQ must have the same bonded parameters as N

Lysine:

. Create atomtype NQ in lys. residue
. Change atomtype N3 of NZ to NQ
. NQ must have the same bonded parameters as N
